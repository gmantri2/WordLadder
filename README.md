**Welcome to Word Ladder!**

**How to Play:**
In Word Ladder, you aim to get from one word to the other by a sequence of single-character modifications. There are ten levels of difficulty and, after successful completion of a level, you will move up to the next. Each level consists of one problem, prompted with two words and the number of steps between them. For example:

head → tail (5 steps)

head -->
heal -->
teal -->
tell -->
tall -->
tail

Each step, you may add, remove, or change one character. You may also get hints or give up if you are stuck. After you finish each problem, you will move up in difficulty to harder problems.

**Instructions:**
From the Word Ladder Github, download the repository as a zip file on your computer or clone the repository on VSCode. Open the terminal and run ‘make’ followed by ‘bin/exec’. These commands can also be found in the comments located at the bottom of the Makefile. Once you’ve run the commands, you will enter the game. 

Follow the onscreen prompts to play the game. When the game starts, you will be presented with two words and a distance of the shortest path between them. Simply enter your guess for the next word in the sequence in the command line and press enter. The game will tell you if you are right or wrong. If you are right, you can repeat these steps until you get the goal word. These instructions can also be found while playing the game.
